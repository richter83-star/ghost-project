# Check Your Fix Results

## What Should Have Happened

The script should have shown a summary like:

```
📊 Summary:
  ✅ Fixed inventory: X variants (products now available)

  ✅ Improved descriptions: X products (AI-generated)

✅ Done! Your products should now:
   - Show as available (not "sold out")

```
