# Verify Your Fixes Were Applied ✅

## What Should Have Been Fixed

### 1. ✅ Inventory Fixed
- All products should now show as **"Available"** instead of "Sold out"
- Check a product page - should see "Add to cart" button

### 2. ✅ Images Added
- Products missing images should now have placeholder images
- Check product listings - all should have images

### 3. ✅ Descriptions Improved
- Products with poor descriptions should now have AI-generated descriptions (150+ words)
- Check product pages - descriptions should be detailed and persuasive

## How to Verify

### Quick Check in Shopify Admin

1. Go to: https://admin.shopify.com/store/dracanus-ai/products
2. Check a few products:
   - **Inventory**: Should not show "0 in stock" warning
   - **Images**: Should have at least one image
   - **Description**: Should be detailed (scroll down to see full description)

### Check Product Pages

1. Visit your store: https://dracanus-ai.myshopify.com
2. Click on a product
3. Verify:
   - Shows "Add to cart" (not "Sold out")
   - Has product image
   - Has detailed description

## What the Script Reported

The script should have shown something like:

```
📊 Summary:
  ✅ Fixed inventory: X variants (products now available)
  ✅ Added images: X products (placeholder images)
  ✅ Improved descriptions: X products (AI-generated)
```

## If Something Still Looks Wrong

- **Still shows "Sold out"**: May need a few minutes for Shopify to update, or check inventory settings manually
- **Missing images**: May need to refresh the page or wait for Shopify to process
- **Poor descriptions**: Some products might have been skipped if generation failed

## Next Steps

✅ **You're done!** Your store should now be fully fixed:
- Products are available
- All have images
- Descriptions are improved
